# Local LLM Home Stack

This repository contains everything needed to stand up a privacy-friendly home lab for large language models and personal search. It combines reproducible Docker services (Ollama, Open WebUI, SearxNG, and Glance), opinionated Glance configuration, and a small Flask extension that lets you send authenticated shutdown/restart commands to the host directly from the dashboard. The Python code is fully covered by tests so you can evolve the automation safely.

---

## At a Glance

| Component | Location | Purpose |
| --------- | -------- | ------- |
| Docker stack | `docker-compose.yml` | Boots Ollama (models), Open WebUI (chat UI), Glance (dashboard), and SearxNG (meta search). |
| Dashboard config | `glance/config`, `glance/assets` | Home page layouts, widgets, and CSS overrides for Glance. |
| Custom API extension | `glance/custom_api_extension` | Flask service that Glance calls to restart or power down the host with per-platform commands and rate limiting. |
| Persistent data | `data/` | Docker bind mounts for Ollama models, Open WebUI, and SearxNG. Ignored from Git to keep the repo lean. |
| Automated tests | `tests/` | Pytest suite validating every Flask endpoint, the token guard, rate limiting, and OS detection helpers. |

---

## Requirements

| Category | Details |
| -------- | ------- |
| Host OS | Linux or Windows with WSL2 (compose file is tuned for WSL GPU passthrough). |
| Containers | Docker 24+ and Docker Compose plugin. NVIDIA Container Toolkit if you want GPU acceleration. |
| Python tooling | Python 3.11+ plus `pip` for running/tests of the Flask extension. |
| Secrets | `.env` file defining at least `MY_SECRET_TOKEN` (shared between Glance and the Flask app) and `MY_PASSWORD` (hashed password for the Glance UI). |

Optional but recommended: `just` or `make` for custom scripts, and a virtual environment manager such as `uv`, `pyenv`, or `rye`.

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-user/local_llm.git
   cd local_llm
   ```

2. **Create an `.env` file**

   ```dotenv
   # Shared secret for Glance auth + Flask token_required decorator
   MY_SECRET_TOKEN=change-me
   # PBKDF2 hash or bcrypt hash – generate with `python -c "from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash; print(generate_password_hash('your-password'))"`
   MY_PASSWORD=pbkdf2:sha256:600000$...
   ```

   Keep this file out of source control (it's already ignored).

3. **Launch everything with the orchestration script**

   ```bash
   python manage_stack.py
   ```

   Each run:
   - Installs Python dependencies from `project.toml` (core + optional groups listed under `[tool.manage_stack.optional_dependency_groups]`).
   - Bootstraps `pip` automatically with `ensurepip` if your Python interpreter was installed without it.
   - Verifies `.env` exists before touching Docker.
   - Recreates the Docker Compose stack, automatically layering in `docker-compose.gpu.yml` when `docker info` reports an NVIDIA runtime.
   - Boots the Flask API (`glance/custom_api_extension/host_flask.py`) once containers are healthy.

   The script now creates/uses a project-local virtual environment (`.venv` by default) so dependency installs never touch the system Python that Debian/Ubuntu marks as "externally managed" (PEP 668). Customize the location or disable this behavior via `[tool.manage_stack] use_virtualenv` / `virtualenv_path` in `project.toml`.

   > **WSL tip:** Ubuntu images sometimes ship without `pip`/`ensurepip`. If the script fails during the bootstrap step, run `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install python3-pip python3-venv` and rerun `python manage_stack.py`.
   > :warning: Avoid `sudo python manage_stack.py` or the `.venv` directory will be owned by root and unusable from your normal user.

4. **Prefer manual control?** (optional)

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   python -m pip install -r glance/custom_api_extension/requirements.txt
   # or, if your tooling consumes `project.toml` / `pyproject.toml`:
   python -m pip install -e .[dev]
   docker compose up -d
   # GPU-enabled manual launch:
   docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.gpu.yml up -d
   ```

   | Service | URL | Notes |
   | ------- | --- | ----- |
   | Ollama | `http://localhost:11434` | Model runtime and embedding server. |
   | Open WebUI | `http://localhost:8081` | Web UI proxied to Ollama, RAG enabled via FAISS. |
   | Glance | `http://localhost:8080` | Dashboard configured by `glance/config`. |
   | SearxNG | `http://localhost:8082` | Self-hosted metasearch for RAG or manual queries. |

   Health checks on Ollama gate Open WebUI startup. GPU passthrough is now opt-in via `docker-compose.gpu.yml`; include it only if your host exposes NVIDIA runtimes.

---

## Stack Automation Script

`manage_stack.py` is the recommended way to (re)start the entire stack:

- Installs dependencies declared in `project.toml`.
- Ensures `.env` exists before issuing Docker commands.
- Detects NVIDIA runtimes via `docker info` and automatically merges `docker-compose.gpu.yml` when available.
- Stops any running containers, recreates the stack, and finally launches the Flask API in the foreground so you can see its logs.

Behaviour is configurable from `[tool.manage_stack]` inside `project.toml`:

```toml
[tool.manage_stack]
base_compose_file = "docker-compose.yml"
gpu_compose_file = "docker-compose.gpu.yml"
optional_dependency_groups = ["dev"]
auto_install_dependencies = true
use_virtualenv = true
virtualenv_path = ".venv"
```

Set `auto_install_dependencies = false` to skip the pip step, change `optional_dependency_groups` if you only want a subset of extras, or point `virtualenv_path` somewhere else (or set `use_virtualenv = false`) if you prefer to manage environments yourself.

## Custom Flask API Extension

Located in `glance/custom_api_extension`, this mini-service exposes authenticated endpoints that Glance widgets can call to control the host.

### Running Locally

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   python -m pip install -r glance/custom_api_extension/requirements.txt
   # or, to honor the dependency lists inside `project.toml`:
   python -m pip install -e .[dev]
   ```

2. **Start the server**

   ```bash
   export FLASK_APP=glance.custom_api_extension.host_flask
   export MY_SECRET_TOKEN=change-me  # or read from .env via `python -m flask run --env-file .env`
   python -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5001
   # direct alternative:
   python glance/custom_api_extension/host_flask.py
   ```

* Rate limiting: default limit is `5 per minute` per IP enforced by `flask-limiter`.
* Auth: `token_required` accepts `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, `Authorization: <token>`, `token` form fields, or `?token=` query params.

### Endpoints

| Route | Method | Description | Platform-specific behavior |
| ----- | ------ | ----------- | -------------------------- |
| `/` | GET | Health check returning `Hello, World!`. Protected by the rate limiter. | – |
| `/shutdown` | POST | Issues `sudo shutdown -h now`, `shutdown /s /t 0`, or equivalent depending on OS. | Linux/WSL/macOS use `sudo shutdown -h now`; Windows uses `shutdown /s /t 0`; unsupported platforms return HTTP 400. |
| `/restart` | POST | Issues safe restart command for the active platform. | Linux/WSL/macOS use `shutdown -r now`; Windows uses `shutdown /r /t 0`. |

Commands are executed via `run_command()` which captures output and surfaces failures with HTTP 500 responses plus stderr payloads. Platform detection logic leans on `platform`, `distro.id`, and heuristics for WSL to keep commands accurate.

## Configuration Reference

| File/Dir | Purpose |
| -------- | ------- |
| `glance/config/glance.yml` | Registers pages, auth strategy, and proxies dashboard env vars from `.env`. |
| `glance/config/home.yml` / `startpage.yml` | Widget layout, RSS feeds, weather, markets, Twitch, and utility groups. Use them as templates for additional pages. |
| `glance/assets/user.css` | Brand the dashboard. Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+F5) after editing due to caching. |
| `config/searxng-config` | Passed-through config directory for SearxNG container. |
| `data/<service>` | Docker bind mounts that retain models, indexes, and user data between restarts. |
| `docker-compose.gpu.yml` | NVIDIA device reservations layered on top of `docker-compose.yml` when GPU acceleration is available. |
| `manage_stack.py` | Automation entry point that installs deps, restarts Compose, and launches the Flask API. |

Feel free to add more compose services (e.g., `qdrant`, `postgres`) – just extend `docker-compose.yml` and Glance labels for discovery.

---

## Testing & Quality

* **Unit tests**: Run `pytest` from the repo root. The suite (36 tests) covers endpoint auth flows, rate limiting, platform branching, and subprocess error handling.
* **Formatting**: `black` keeps code style consistent (`black .`).
* **Linting**: `ruff` (optional) catches import order and logical issues early (`ruff check .`).

CI is not bundled, but the commands above are what the project expects before pushing changes.

---

## Maintenance & Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
| ----- | --- |
| Rate limiter blocking tests | The default pytest client fixture disables the limiter; toggle `app.config['RATELIMIT_ENABLED'] = True` inside a test to cover limiter behavior (see `tests/test_api_endpoints.py:test_index_rate_limiting_enforced`). |
| Permission errors on shutdown/restart | Ensure the user that runs the Flask API has sudo rights without a password prompt or adjust `run_command` to call privileged helper scripts. |
| GPU not visible inside Ollama container | Install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit, verify `docker info | grep -i nvidia`, then either run `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.gpu.yml up -d` or rerun `python manage_stack.py` so the GPU overrides are applied. |
| Glance auth failing | Regenerate `MY_PASSWORD` hash with Werkzeug and keep `MY_SECRET_TOKEN` identical across `.env` and any widgets hitting the Flask API. |
